    <p>That u build a house cathedral for worship doesn't make u a child of God.
That'u are faithful in paying of ur tithe and offering doesn't make u a child of God.
That u give to less privileges doesn't make u a child of God.
That u provide for the motherless home doesn't make u a child of God and many more..
Though those things are good but they are not the qualifications of u as a child of God..
The scripture says that all things can be helpful but not all things are lawful.
Those things can be helpful to human being and for the society but they are not lawful bcus they don't have a spiritual definition..
The law is that u must accept Jesus Christ as ur personal lord and savior and be born again.
Thus: except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.(John 3vs3)
U can be doing all those things but u are still a pathetic sinner,lier, corrupt man and even an immoral personality full of devils manipulation..
U will have ur rewards for doing those things bcus is a spiritual law that whomsoever ever that gives shall receive back.
Ur reward will only be here on earth but u will never see the kingdom of God..
Forget all those fantasy u have been seeing on the internet of one paying for the school fees of a student or helping someone that is handicap financially..
All those things are rubbish if the person doing all those kind gesture have not received Christ..
He will only receive the praise, accolades and the worship of men but can never have approval in heaven by God..
God doesn't bless a sinner, God bless one who is of Him..
The blessings of the lord is not money,car,houses,wife,visa nor whatsoever..the blessings of the lord is LIFE!!
That's why he instructed us to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness..(Mathew 6vs33) then all this can be handed over to us..
Zeal without knowledge has made people to misinterpret righteousness.
What is righteousness?
Righteousness is an effort one applied to do the will of God or the price payed to be in right stand with God..
The will of God is not to build churches here and there..
The will of God is not for the opening of the blind eyes of the raising of dead..
The will of God is not for helping the needy.
The will of God is not for providing for the motherless home..
Apparently ""those things are necessary for the sake of man well being but that's not the main target of God..
The main target of God is to multiply His life in men.
Is to save a sinner from the bondage of sin into life in Christ Jesus Christ..
Is to put His fear in the heart of men that men will live to please Him..
Is to build His word in the soul of men..And many more..
Outside this,then the church have not started the main aim of the gospel..
Forget that dragging in the church where an usher will be instructed by the pastor to give that man that always contribute in church projects front sit or special sit..
Ignorant has put many peoples in bondage that they are doing everything they are doing thinking they are pleasing God but ironically they are not..
We need the truth of Christ back to the church again where main will know the most important rather than knowing the important without any spiritual growth nor advancement..
See u soon!!</p>
