            <p>Hello! My name is Solomon Itie and I am from Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. 
               I enjoy Swiming, I am web developer working for companies in Nigeria. Some my hobbies are woodworking, swimming(surfing), Photography and film. I hope to learn beyond the basic knowledge I have of web design and be able to create wonderful designs.</p>
               I decided to study Web delovpment and design because I couldn't decide between Industrial design and computer science, I feel that it is a nice spot between those careers, I hope to get more into design in the future.</p>
