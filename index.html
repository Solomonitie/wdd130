               <h1>Inemesit Ufot CEO White Water Rafting Company</h1>
               <img src="./images/profile1.jpg" alt="My picture">
               <p>I am Inemesit Ufot, a dedicated and motivated individual from Nigeria with a deep passion for
                    technology,
                    innovation, and continuous learning. I enjoy exploring new ideas, solving complex problems, and
                    finding
                    practical
                    solutions that improve efficiency and create positive impact. My curiosity drives me to stay updated
                    with
                    emerging
                    trends in technology, while my hands-on experience strengthens my ability to adapt and perform
                    effectively in
                    dynamic environments.

                    Beyond my professional interests, I am an enthusiastic football lover who values teamwork,
                    discipline,
                    and
                    perseverance qualities that shape both my personal and professional approach to life. I take pride
                    in
                    being
                    reliable, hardworking, and goal-oriented, always ready to learn from others and contribute
                    meaningfully
                    to any
                    team or project I am part of. With a strong sense of responsibility and a commitment to excellence,
                    I
                    strive to
                    make a difference through dedication, creativity, and continuous self improvement.</p>

               <p>That u build a house cathedral for worship doesn't make u a child of God.
                    That'u are faithful in paying of ur tithe and offering doesn't make u a child of God.
                    That u give to less privileges doesn't make u a child of God.
                    That u provide for the motherless home doesn't make u a child of God and many more..
                    Though those things are good but they are not the qualifications of u as a child of God..
                    The scripture says that all things can be helpful but not all things are lawful.
                    Those things can be helpful to human being and for the society but they are not lawful bcus they
                    don't
                    have a
                    spiritual definition..
                    The law is that u must accept Jesus Christ as ur personal lord and savior and be born again.
                    Thus: except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.(John 3vs3)
                    U can be doing all those things but u are still a pathetic sinner,lier, corrupt man and even an
                    immoral
                    personality full of devils manipulation..
                    U will have ur rewards for doing those things bcus is a spiritual law that whomsoever ever that
