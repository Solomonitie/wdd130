    <p>Akwa Ibom is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It borders Cross River State to the east,
      Rivers State and Abia State to the west and north-west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. The state takes its
      name from the Qua Iboe River which bisects the state before flowing into the Bight of Bonny. Akwa Ibom was split
      from Cross River State in 1987. The state has 31 local government areas, and its capital is Uyo.</p>
